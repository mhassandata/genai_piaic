These are the basic questions about Typescript and Node.js for the beginers.

1. Install Node.js, TypeScript and VS Code (Done with it.)
2. Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Hassan, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?”

3. Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

4. Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

5. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.
